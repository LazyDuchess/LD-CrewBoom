# LD CrewBoom
This Repository is a custom fork of the [CrewBoom Unity Project](https://github.com/LunaCapra/CrewBoom).

## Features
* Stubbed Dynamic Bones scripts are included.
* GUIDs for custom characters are editable and stay the same unless changed. This allows you to update custom characters without generating a new GUID each time.
* Small QoL changes.
* Customizable recreations of BRC shaders are included so you can tweak character outlines or give them transparent meshes that still react properly to the game's shading.
