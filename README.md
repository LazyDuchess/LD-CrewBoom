# LD CrewBoom
This Repository is a custom fork of the [CrewBoom Unity Project](https://github.com/LunaCapra/CrewBoom).

## Features
* Stubbed Dynamic Bones scripts are included.
* Bundle names are editable and author name prefixed to avoid conflicts.
* GUIDs for custom characters are editable and stay the same unless changed. This allows you to update custom characters without generating a new GUID each time.
* Quality of Life improvements.
* Customizable recreations of BRC shaders are included. These can be used in place of the Game Shaders.
* Custom shaders by [Muppo](https://github.com/Muppotronic) are included.
* Ability to auto-update the Tools directly in the editor.
* Ability to preview your characters and their animations.

## Usage
Head to the "Releases" tab to download the latest version. You'll be able to use this as a replacement for the CrewBoom Unity Project.
